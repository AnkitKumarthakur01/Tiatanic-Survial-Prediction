# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction 🚀

## 📌 Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using various passenger attributes such as age, fare, class, and sex. The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of passenger details, including:
- 🆔 PassengerId
- 🎟️ Pclass (Ticket class)
- 🏷️ Name
- 👤 Sex
- 🎂 Age
- 👨‍👩‍👦 SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- 👪 Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
- 🎫 Ticket number
- 💰 Fare
- 🏠 Cabin
- ⚓ Embarked (Port of Embarkation)
- ✅ Survived (Target variable: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python
- 📊 Pandas
- 🔢 NumPy
- 🤖 Scikit-learn
- 📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn
- 📝 Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. **📌 Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling
2. **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing survival rates based on different features
   - Finding correlations between variables
3. **🤖 Model Selection & Training**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. **📏 Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC Curve

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnkitKumarthakur01/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open and execute the notebook to train and evaluate models.

## 📊 Results
- The best model achieved an accuracy of **X%**.
- Feature importance analysis showed that gender and ticket class were strong predictors of survival.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning techniques (e.g., Neural Networks)
- Tune hyperparameters using Grid Search or Random Search
- Feature engineering for improved model performance
